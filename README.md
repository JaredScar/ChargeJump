This is a plugin which your jump charges from your shifting. If I shift for a while, 
when I let go I will jump as high as I have been shifting for. The plugin was made for [this plugin request] (https://forums.bukkit.org/threads/request-charge-your-jumps.285378/). 
This would be useful for climbing mountains and getting to high places with a semi-realistic feel.
